##Overview

This project is split across multiple branches that iterate upwards from 1 i.e CarFactory-Stage-1. Each branch will have a different README file 
that will inform you on what todo in the next stage.

Read the README file for all steps, execute the instructions using the java development skills you've aquired.

Once you have completed the stage please **DO NOT** commit the branch back, any pull requests on the branch i will decline.

if you wish to save your work then please sub-branch the branch when you are finished.

please **DO NOT edit the tests in anyway**, the premise of this exercise is to get them working.


##Next step

checkout branch one using the command: 
```
git checkout CarFactory-Stage-1
```
