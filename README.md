#Stage 1 Creating the Factory

##Overview

Ok, in this stage we want to extend the range of colours that the Model T supports from 1
to 3, we now want to include the following colours (RED, BLUE) 

As before run the unit tests first to see which are failing before starting to write
any code.
 
##Need To Know

So to test your implementation, navigate to the directory of the pom.xml file.
enter the following command

```
mvn clean install
```

once you have completed and ALL the tests pass please proceed to stage 2.
